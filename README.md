This is code for my first game which I named Daysoness.
I started to develop this game in September 2023 in Unity.
I am planned to create 2D, pixel style game with open world in which game will 
not give any hint to the player what he should do in this world and how to win. 
Player should eplore world, interact with it and try to find out what to do.
I didn't plan to publish it somwhere when I finish it. This game is 
like learning for me how to code games.
My code here is really crap, because when I coded this I didn't know OOP and didn't have many experience in that.
