This is code for my first game which I named Daysoness.
I started to develop this game in September 2023 in Unity.
I was planning to create 2D, pixel style game with open world in which game will 
not give any hint to the player what they should do in this world and how to win. 
Player should explore the world, interact with it and try to find out what to do.
I didn't plan to publish it somwhere when I finish it. I created this game just 
to improve my skills in game developing.

In January 2026 I decided to rewrite all the code in this game, so now it looks much better
and I am planning to improve this game. Add SFX, music, animations, particles and create
this open world!
